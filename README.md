This repository outlines key components of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and provides practical recommendations for small businesses, particularly in the finance sector.

## Overview

A small finance-sector startup with one office location has identified the need for better network protection. IDS offers a low-cost, scalable solution to monitor and respond to potential threats. This README highlights two essential IDS components that are well-suited for such an environment.

## Recommended Components

### Network-Based Sensors

Network-based sensors monitor traffic at critical points in the network, such as between internal systems and the internet. They help detect suspicious activity like unauthorized access attempts, phishing payloads, and data exfiltration. For a finance startup, this visibility is crucial to protect sensitive client data and financial records.

### Hybrid Detection Engine (Signature + Anomaly-Based)

A detection engine that combines signature-based and anomaly-based methods offers a balanced approach to threat identification. Signature-based detection flags known attacks quickly, while anomaly-based detection uncovers unusual behavior that may indicate zero-day exploits or insider threats. This hybrid model is ideal for small teams without dedicated security analysts, as it automates much of the threat detection process.

## Benefits

- Cost-effective and scalable for small environments
- Enhances visibility into network activity
- Supports compliance with financial regulations
- Provides early detection of both known and unknown threats
